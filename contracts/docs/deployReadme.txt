Deployment Steps:
The taxAddress refers to the specific address where all the tax proceeds are forwarded to once the tokenLiquidityThreshold is achieved. To initiate this, you deploy the contract via contract.deploy(taxAddress).

To start trading, activate the function contract.startTrading().

Token Distribution:
The contract will mint 1 trillion tokens to the contract creator, who is regarded as the owner. It is then required that the token allocations be manually transferred to the preferred wallets.

Liquidity Provision:
The liquidity should be supplied to Uniswapv2, which includes both the token and ether. In case you require the contract for the pair, you can request it via contract.getPair(). This will return the address for the BPP/WETH pair.

Adjusting Fees:

The contract has four categories: poors, borderline, middleclass, and upperclass. These categories are stored in an associative array featuring the structure:

struct FeeThreshold {
uint256 balanceThreshold;
uint256 fee;
}

This structure allows for the adjustment of the balanceThreshold and/or fee as needed.

Example:

Let's consider the following modified thresholds:

let classes = [

    { name: "poors", balanceThreshold: ethers.utils.parseEther('500000000'), fee: 1000 },
    { name: "borderline", balanceThreshold: ethers.utils.parseEther('5000000000'), fee: 750 },
    { name: "middleclass", balanceThreshold: ethers.utils.parseEther('9000000000'), fee: 500 },
    { name: "upperclass", balanceThreshold: ethers.utils.parseEther('15000000000'), fee: 250 }
];
For each category in classes, execute the function setFeeThreshold to adjust the balanceThreshold and fee:

javascript code
for (let cls of classes) {
    const setFeeThresholdTx = await feeContract.setFeeThreshold(cls.name, cls.balanceThreshold, cls.fee);
    await setFeeThresholdTx.wait();

    const newFeeThreshold = await feeContract.feeThresholds(cls.name);
    console.log(`New threshold for ${cls.name}: ${newFeeThreshold.balanceThreshold.toString()}, ${newFeeThreshold.fee.toString()}`);
}
